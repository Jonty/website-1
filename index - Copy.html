<blockquote>
.reality [2014 edition]

Meetings are the last Tuesday of the month except December...

    August 26th
    September 30th
    October 28th
    November 25th
    December tbc

<B>Talks</B>

Format is two normally talks: a primary 1 hour (ish) and a secondary 30 minutes (ish)
Talks start at 19:30 but we have the room from about 18:30 to 23:00 or so.

+++

Where
=====

For our August meeting we are temporarily moving to the downstairs bar
at The Albany, 240 Great Portland Street, W1W 5QU.
(This move is due to the refurbishment of the downstairs bar at The Phoenix.)

The downstairs bar at The Albany has a stage area and a projector, but
it is a peculiar shape for giving presentations as many seats cannot
see the stage.

+++

What
====

1. Lightning Talks, up to 15 minutes each.

2. Activity tables, maybe form groups to share an interest in Software
Defined Radios, (eg people who want to know what to do with their new
HackRF) or locksports.

+++

Who
===

We have two Lightning Talk proposals so far, but you can also turn up
on the night and talk.

Subject: DEF CON 22, CTF finals, the game & some of the cool challenges
Speakers: Peter LaFosse and Psifertex from (Mostly) Men in Black Hats

Subject: Introduction to SCADA, how computer controlled industiral systems have evolved.
Speaker: Dom Cashley


The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. You can be an expert, a student
or someone learning a new area, maybe a regular speaker on the
conference circuit, but we are also very welcoming to new speakers,
and their often new ideas or perspectives.
