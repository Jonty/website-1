<h4>November 25th</h4>
Talks evening ...

Tech Talk Speaker: Geoffrey Hill, from Artis-Secure Ltd

Title: Cloud-based Data Validation patterns… We need a new approach!

Synopsis:

Current methodology in nearly every organisation is to create data validation 
gates. But when an organisation implements a cloud-based strategy, these 
security-quality gates may inadvertently become bypassed or suppressed. This 
talk discusses a methodology to encapsulate the validation at the object
level, thus allowing each object to have validated or sanitised data at any 
given point in time.

Two kinds of patterns will be discussed, a validated object pattern and a 
tokenised object pattern. Examples of use-cases will be detailed for the delegates.

Advantages and possible pitfalls of these patterns in security design will also be reviewed.

Examples will be given in several main programming languages.

Tech Talk Speaker: Jordan Wiens, @psifertex

Title: Capture The Flag - the dirty tricks stories

Synopsis:

Psifertex likes CTFs. He's coming up on 10 years of playing them, and he refuses 
to grow up. At DEF CON a few years back he shared a few dirty tricks he's seen 
or done, but some years later there's a whole fresh batch of nastiness to relish. 
Part CTF-old-timey-nostalgia, part fresh reveal of never-public techniques, come 
hear about the parts you usually don't get to learn just watching a CTF's scoreboard.


<h4>December mid-month</h4>
Pre-holidays meetup, access to the Christmas menu,
details soon ...


<h3>Talks</h3>
Format is usually two talks: a primary 1 hour (ish) and,
a secondary 30 minutes (ish).
Talks start at 19:30, but we have the room from about
18:30 to 23:00.


<h2>Speakers Wanted</h2>
Typically our programme has a technical talk (~1 hr) and lighter talk (~30 min).
Once or twice a year we have a &quot;Lightning Talk&quot; format, with shorter
talks up to ~15 minutes, with anyone who wants to speak on the night.

The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. The subject can be on technical 
or security issues, social interaction with technology, based on the
current events, or just something entertaining to our attendees.
As a speaker you can be an expert, a student, someone learning a new
area, maybe a regular speaker on the conference circuit, but we also
love to have new & occasional speakers.


We welcome occasional company pitches, to sell or recruit, but to regulate
the frequency of these we ask you to buy a round of drinks. Also please
discuss with Major Malfunction or Tony beforehand!
