1st Talk:

Pwning android via nfc/bluetooth

Speaker:

Adam Laurie, Aperture Labs Ltd
(@rfidiot)

Synopsis:

I've just been given the go-ahead by ZDI/Google to spill the beans on the
pwn2own (joint) winning entry in Tokyo last November, in which I pwned Android
via NFC & Bluetooth...

I'm not going to give too much away before the event, but suffice it to
say I pwned Android hard, and he/she/it loved it :) - I will do a live
demo, and it will make you install that system update you've been
resisting for weeks (if not, don't forget to come and see me after the
show so I can follow you at a discreet distance for a few minutes...).

This was my first entry in pwn2own (or any such competition for that
matter), so I'll talk not only about the hack itself, but also the whole
concept of bounties and competitions. I hope this will spark some debate
and to turn this into a lively discussion, so if you have a strong
opinion on the subject, please come along!

Oh, and bring your Android phone...

2nd Talk:

An expression of elegance, base 3 math

Speaker:

Stuart Ward

Synopsis:

We will explore a forgotten alternative to binary, called balanced ternery.
How the maths works and some of the neat things it does.



<h3>Talk nights</h3>
Format is usually two talks: a primary 1 hour (ish) and,
a secondary 30 minutes (ish).
Talks start at 19:30, but we have the room from about
18:30 to 23:00.


<h2>Speakers Wanted</h2>
Typically our programme has a technical talk (~1 hr) and lighter talk (~30 min).
Once or twice a year we have a &quot;Lightning Talk&quot; format, with shorter
talks up to ~15 minutes, with anyone who wants to speak on the night.

The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. The subject can be on technical 
or security issues, social interaction with technology, based on the
current events, or just something entertaining to our attendees.
As a speaker you can be an expert, a student, someone learning a new
area, maybe a regular speaker on the conference circuit, but we also
love to have new & occasional speakers.

Send your talk / activity proposals to <A HREF="mailto:talks@dc4420.org?subject=DC4420%20Talk">talks@dc4420.org</A> 

You are very welcome to propose running activities other than talks, such
as hands-on workshop or an infosec pub quiz, or something else relevant to our
techie audience!

We also welcome occasional company pitches, to sell or recruit, but to regulate
the frequency of these we ask you to buy a round of drinks. Also please
discuss with Major Malfunction or Tony beforehand!
