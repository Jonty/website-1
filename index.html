Speaker:

Kyriakos Economou (<a href="https://twitter.com/kyREcon">@kyREcon</a>

Title:

A short overview for <a href="http://www.anti-reversing.com/">Shellter v1.0</a>

Synopsis: 

It is a dynamic shellcode injector (maybe the first really
dynamic PE infector). It can be used to hide shellcode into
native 32-bit applications without using any static executable
templates for which it would make easy writing AV detection
signatures.

Won't use any static locations, won't modify the original
EntryPoint, won't add sections, won't change original access
rights of sections defined in the PE header.

Shellter will gather information during the execution of an
application and then will use this in conjunction with the
payload selected in order to provide to the user a set of
locations where execution is guaranteed to fall on the 1st
instruction of the injected shellcode without breaking the
shellcode or the execution prior to execute the injected
shellcode.

The engine is capable of recognizing self-modifying code on
the run and during filtering to avoid injecting into location
that would break the shellcode. The filtering stages also
perform more analysis to guarantee a successfull shellcode
injection.

Shellter also includes a junk code generating polymorphic
engine. It also supports encoded/self-decrypting payloads,
and it does that without modifying the executable host with
extra sections with dodgy access rights (RWE), or changing
the permissions of the existing ones. Everything happens in
memory, dynamically.

No static executable templates, just get any native 32-bit
executable and use it as a host as many times as you want and
produce a different result every time.
