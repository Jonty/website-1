(Postponed from June)

1st Speaker:

Eireann Leverett

Title:

Classify 6

Synopsis:

I wrote a simple IPv6 address classifier in OCAML, and I learn a lot
about the addresses along the way. If you need to classify large amounts
of addresses this tool needs a user base and some feedback. I benchmarke
d it at 1 Million addresses in under 30 seconds, and 11GB of Addresses
in 1 Hr 35 mins. It won't help you hack anything, but it will teach you
about the IPv6 addresses, and I could use the advice of the community on
progressing it further.

2nd Speaker:

Jon Gilbert

Title:

TBC

Synopsis:

Introduction to DNS flux and domain name generation, as used for botnet command & control.
