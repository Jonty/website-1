1st Speaker:

Tom Keetch (<a href="https://twitter.com/tkeetch">@tkeetch</a>)

Bio:

Tom Keetch works as a Security Researcher for <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a> and has
been working to secure the NFC implementation in the BB10 OS. He is
also involved in other aspects of mobile device security including
the QNX OS, secure-boot, ARM TrustZone, the web browserand BBM and
sandboxing.

Title:

NFC - the non-radio bits

Synopsis:

When we talk about NFC, often people think of the short-range radio
protocol and RFID. But that's only a small part of the picture. Smart
cards play an important role in NFC and this presentation will focus
on how NFC standards build on and extend smart card security concepts
to enable applications like contactless mobile payments.

2nd Speaker:

Eireann Leverett

Title:

Classify 6

Synopsis:

I wrote a simple IPv6 address classifier in OCAML, and I learn a lot
about the addresses along the way. If you need to classify large amounts
of addresses this tool needs a user base and some feedback. I benchmarke
d it at 1 Million addresses in under 30 seconds, and 11GB of Addresses
in 1 Hr 35 mins. It won't help you hack anything, but it will teach you
about the IPv6 addresses, and I could use the advice of the community on
progressing it further.
