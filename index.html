<h4>MONDAY, December 15th</h4>

Christmas Social

Friendly opportunity for drinks & chat before the Christmas holidays.

<a href="/PhoenixFestiveMenu.pdf">You can preorder food from the Phoenix Christmas Menu.</a>

<h3>Talks</h3>
Format is usually two talks: a primary 1 hour (ish) and,
a secondary 30 minutes (ish).
Talks start at 19:30, but we have the room from about
18:30 to 23:00.


<h2>Speakers Wanted</h2>
Typically our programme has a technical talk (~1 hr) and lighter talk (~30 min).
Once or twice a year we have a &quot;Lightning Talk&quot; format, with shorter
talks up to ~15 minutes, with anyone who wants to speak on the night.

The qualifications for speakers are simple, have a subject of interest
to fellow technical & InfoSec people. The subject can be on technical 
or security issues, social interaction with technology, based on the
current events, or just something entertaining to our attendees.
As a speaker you can be an expert, a student, someone learning a new
area, maybe a regular speaker on the conference circuit, but we also
love to have new & occasional speakers.


We welcome occasional company pitches, to sell or recruit, but to regulate
the frequency of these we ask you to buy a round of drinks. Also please
discuss with Major Malfunction or Tony beforehand!
