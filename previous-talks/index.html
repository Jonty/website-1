1st Speaker:

Tom Keetch (<a href="https://twitter.com/tkeetch">@tkeetch</a>)

Bio:

Tom Keetch works as a Security Researcher for <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">BlackBerry</a> and has
been working to secure the NFC implementation in the BB10 OS. He is
also involved in other aspects of mobile device security including
the QNX OS, secure-boot, ARM TrustZone, the web browserand BBM and
sandboxing.

Title:

NFC - the non-radio bits

Synopsis:

When we talk about NFC, often people think of the short-range radio
protocol and RFID. But that's only a small part of the picture. Smart
cards play an important role in NFC and this presentation will focus
on how NFC standards build on and extend smart card security concepts
to enable applications like contactless mobile payments.

Planned 2nd speaker was ill, and his talk was postponed until July.

We had an improvised second talk instead.

2nd Speakers:

Adam Laurie, Aperature Labs (<a href="https://twitter.com/rfidiot">@rfidiot</a>)

Tony Naggs (<a href="https://twitter.com/xa329">@xa329</a>)

Title:

Title:

Mobile phone hacking - lucrative, but hidden

Synopsis:

Mobile phone hacking has been going on for many years, but if you
listen to most security companies, they'll only talk about the iPhone
and Android. Either that, or they'll talk about mobile malware. This
talk gives some of the real background, from the late 90s through
until the present day including the jailbreaking and rooting
community’s roots in SIMlock and car radio hacking. Some impressive,
but questionably legal engineering feats that made a lot of people
a lot of money, but with little publicity.

Title:

A short overview for Shellter v1.0
<a href="http://www.shellterproject.com/">http://www.shellterproject.com/</a>

Synopsis: 

It is a dynamic shellcode injector (maybe the first really dynamic PE
infector). It can be used to hide shellcode into native 32-bit
applications without using any static executable templates for which it
would make easy writing AV detection signatures.

Won't use any static locations, won't modify the original
EntryPoint, won't add sections, won't change original access rights
of sections defined in the PE header.

Shellter will gather information during the execution of an
application and then will use this in conjunction with the payload
selected in order to provide to the user a set of locations where
execution is guaranteed to fall on the 1st instruction of the
injected shellcode without breaking the shellcode or the execution
prior to execute the injected shellcode.

The engine is capable of recognizing self-modifying code on the run
and during filtering to avoid injecting into location that would
break the shellcode. The filtering stages also perform more analysis
to guarantee a successfull shellcode injection.

Shellter also includes a junk code generating polymorphic engine. It
also supports encoded/self-decrypting payloads, and it does that
without modifying the executable host with extra sections with dodgy
access rights (RWE), or changing the permissions of the existing
ones. Everything happens in memory, dynamically.

No static executable templates, just get any native 32-bit
executable and use it as a host as many times as you want and
produce a different result every time.

Tuesday 29th April, 2014:

April DC4420 was sponsored by Cigital - <a href="http://www.cigital.co.uk/">www.cigital.co.uk</a>
Cigital bought a round of drinks for everyone.

Agenda:

We have one speaker for you this month, after which the mic is open to
anyone with a short talk they want to share.

Speaker:
Paco Hope, Cigital

Title:
Bugs versus flaws

Synopsis:
A fun look at the differences between a bug (glitch in the code)
versus a flaw (problem in the design itself).

Title:

Playing tag - the online version

Synopsis:

A picture says 1000 words, some of them say great stories (and some not).

Title:

Predicting Susceptibility to Social Bots

Synopsis:

Are some Twitter users more naturally predisposed to interacting with
social bots and can social bot creators exploit this knowledge to
increase the odds of getting a response?

Social bots are growing more intelligent, moving beyond simple reposts
of boilerplate ad content to attempt to engage with users and then
exploit this trust to promote a product or agenda. While much research
has focused on how to identify such bots in the process of spam
detection, less research has looked at the other side of the
question--detecting users likely to be fooled by bots.

This talk provides a summary of research and developments in the
social bots arms race before sharing results of our experiment
examining user susceptibility.

We find that a users' Klout score, friends count, and followers count
are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and
that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when
used in conjunction with appropriate feature ranking algorithms. With
this knowledge, social bot creators could significantly reduce the
chance of targeting users who are unlikely to interact.

Users displaying higher levels of extroversion were more likely to
interact with our social bots. This may have implications for
eLearning based awareness training as users higher in extraversion
have been shown to perform better when they have greater control of
the learning environment.

Overall, these results show promise for helping understand which users
are most vulnerable to social bots.

Title:

USBProxy - building a cheap and open USB MitM device

Synopsis:

With the introduction of FaceDancer, there has been a surge of
interest in USB security. USBProxy is an open framework for the
BeagleBone Black to make it simpler for anyone to monitor, inject or
modify data carried over a USB connection. While the FaceDancer will
allow devices to be written on a host system, we are able to go
further and man-in-the-middle connections to existing devices as well.
The BeagleBone Black also enables us to operate at USB 2.0 Hi-Speed
