# 2nd Talk

## What's in your pocket?

### Speaker

Henri Watson ([@henriwatson](https://twitter.com/henriwatson))

### Synopsis

Although we're starting to see computers built into lightbulbs
and refrigerators, we've been quietly surrounded by smaller computers
all along. SIM cards, modern passports, student cards, transit cards,
and access cards contain microprocessors featuring limited storage and
cryptographic abilities. This talk explores what data smartcards store
and how they protect the stored data.

### Bio

Born in California and raised in the Dominican Republic, Henri is a
student at Abertay University and will be the Ethical Hacking society's
secretary for the 2016-2017 academic year.
