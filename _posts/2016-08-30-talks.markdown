# 1st Talk

## The Bits Between The Camera And The Screen

### Speaker

Alex Shelley ([@_shell_e](https://twitter.com/_shell_e))

### Synopsis

Having substituted the maroon trousers, Apple gear and hipster mindset associated with the media
circus, with a classified dresscode, terminal and mindset of the financial sector over a year ago.
Alex has decided to don the maroon trousers one last time and provide a ground-up insight of how
television broadcasting technology works - What those coloured bars are all about and how moving pictures
are created and distributed around the World presented to multi-platform devices.

Interesting Warm-up Fact: The Dodd-Frank Act is NOT a fantasy 70s comedy duo - Rather a Wall Street Financial Services reform act introduced in 2010 - Ooh I say!
