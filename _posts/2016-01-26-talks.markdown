# 1st Talk

## The Pageantry of Lateral Movement

### Speaker

Stuart Morgan, MWR InfoSecurity

### Synopsis

In order to meaningfully compromise a client, you need to take advantage of
every opportunity to gather information and laterally move around the network.
Understanding the structure of a network that you are attempting to compromise
is a necessity these days, which can also be a challenge during attack 
simulation exercises, especially on windows networks which have a complicated
active directory structure.

This talk will discuss ways of abusing Pageant (PuTTY's SSH agent) on a fully
patched Windows host, including a demonstration of a meterpreter extension
which can tunnel SSH agent traffic in a manner that is almost undetectable
with default logging options, and the way that an existing reconnaissance tool
from 2012 was improved to make its output easier to use during a simulated
attack or penetration test. 

This talk explains the development journey resulting in these tools,
especially when there was no particularly useful documentation available,
and should encourage others to develop and share tools and techniques
within the security industry.
