# 1st Talk

## What Can WatchDogs Teach Us About Cyber Security?

### Speaker

Nick Drage ([@SonOfSunTzu](https://twitter.com/SonOfSunTzu))

### Synopsis

*Note: this talk was postponed due to technical to November*

Watch_Dogs is an Ubisoft video game, released in 2014, set in a
fictionalised Chicago where a central network of computers connects
everyone and everything using ctOS, the Central Operating System. You
play as Aiden Pearce, ""a brilliant hacker and former thug"",
manipulating ctOS to your own ends from your smartphone, the game
combines an open world single player mode with an "always-on" feature
whereby your current session may be invaded by another online player at
any time and without your consent or knowledge.

The way the game was and is promoted, designed, coded, updated,
administered, and played provides numerous illustrations of the
challenges within Information Security that we all face in one way or
another. In this talk I'll take you, Inception like, through the
different levels of understanding the game and what it can teach us
about those challenges - all the way in to the point of view of the main
protagonist, all the way out to the viewpoint of the online gamer,
stopping off at Smart Cities, Security Analytics, and the value of
Metadata along the way.
