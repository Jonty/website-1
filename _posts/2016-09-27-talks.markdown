We have two confirmed talks for our 28th June meeting.


# 1st Talk

## FREEMAN - The Perils of Security Abandonware

### Speaker

Andy Settle ([@iC3N1](https://twitter.com/iC3N1))

### Synopsis

Everyone loves OllyDBG.  For many reasons, including the
number and diversity of plug-ins available.  Many of the plug-ins are
used within both the security research community as well as by some bad
people.  Some even have vulnerabilities,  we know this because we have
found one (maybe two-ish).  Knowing this allows us to pop-calc, but this
not really the story we want to tell.  The fact that OllyDBG and some of
it's plug-ins are now 'abandonware' serves as an object lesson to us in
the security community, and one we need to learn from before pointing
and laughing at users who still have macros enabled by default in
Microsoft Office.


# 2nd Talk

## TBC
