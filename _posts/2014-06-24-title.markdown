## Bio

Tom Keetch works as a Security Researcher for BlackBerry and has
been working to secure the NFC implementation in the BB10 OS. He is
also involved in other aspects of mobile device security including
the QNX OS, secure-boot, ARM TrustZone, the web browserand BBM and

## Title

NFC - the non-radio bits

## Synopsis

When we talk about NFC, often people think of the short-range radio
protocol and RFID. But that's only a small part of the picture. Smart
cards play an important role in NFC and this presentation will focus
on how NFC standards build on and extend smart card security concepts
to enable applications like contactless mobile payments.
