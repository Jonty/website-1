We have two confirmed talks for our 28th June meeting.


# 1st Talk

## Token Based Authentication for eCommerce Application Architecture

### Speaker

Tom Keetch ([@tkeetch](https://twitter.com/tkeetch))


### Synopsis

Using authentication token technologies such as SAML, JWT or node.js Iron can have significant benefits for the 
scalability and flexibility of web applications - especially for the implementation of Single Sign On (SSO) 
across multiple websites, or as part of a micro-services architecture. But there are also significant design 
decisions and trade-offs to be made. This talk will discuss when authentication tokens can be useful, design 
considerations for implementers , what to look for as an attacker and how those bugs could be exploited.


A previous talk from Glyn Wintle from the February DC4420 focussed on SAML, whereas this talk will go into more 
detail about JWT and Iron for node.js.

 

### Speaker Bio:
