# 1st Talk

## SAML -- Security Assertion Markup Language -- Yep its broken.

### Speaker

Glyn Wintle ([@glynwintle](https://twitter.com/glynwintle))

### Synopsis

Glyn will explain how SAML works (yes there will be lots of
xkcd cartoons), the flaws found in standard deployments and
give example in most implementations, walk through some of
the attack techniques that work with any xml based protocol
and digital signatures before going deeper into some more
technobabble just for you.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML, pronounced sam-el)
is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging
authentication and authorization data between parties, in
particular, between an identity provider and a service
provider. Think enterprise single signon, used by governments,
large companies, web sites, what could possibly go wrong?
