### Speaker

Various

### Synopsis

As usual, we're asking attendees of DefCon 23, BSides Las Vegas,
Blackhat or CCCamp this month to describe their favourite workshops, talks
or other activities they got up to. This will take the form of a
series of speakers, for various lengths of time.

More speakers are welcome (we have a projector with HDMI & VGA inputs if you want to show slides) - please drop a message to {{ site.email }}
so we can provide a line-up.
