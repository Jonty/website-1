# 1st Talk

## Pwning android via nfc/bluetooth

### Speaker

Adam Laurie, Aperture Labs Ltd [@rfidiot](http://twitter.com/rfidiot)

### Synopsis

I've just been given the go-ahead by ZDI/Google to spill the beans on the
pwn2own (joint) winning entry in Tokyo last November, in which I pwned Android
via NFC & Bluetooth...

I'm not going to give too much away before the event, but suffice it to
say I pwned Android hard, and he/she/it loved it :) - I will do a live
demo, and it will make you install that system update you've been
resisting for weeks (if not, don't forget to come and see me after the
show so I can follow you at a discreet distance for a few minutes...).

This was my first entry in pwn2own (or any such competition for that
matter), so I'll talk not only about the hack itself, but also the whole
concept of bounties and competitions. I hope this will spark some debate
and to turn this into a lively discussion, so if you have a strong
opinion on the subject, please come along!

Oh, and bring your Android phone...
