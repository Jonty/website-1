# 2nd Talk

## A brief introduction to fuzzing using american fuzzy lop

### Speaker

Hugh Davenport

### Synopsis

Fuzzing is the art of applying random data in the hopes of finding inputs
to programs that cause unexpected behaviours. Traditionally, this has taken
a deterministic approach which is akin to something to do with monkeys,
typewriters, and Shakespear. Enter american fuzzy lop (afl), not just a 
[weird looking bunny][1], but actually a new generation fuzzer from Google
that takes into account code coverage.

This talk will give a brief overview of afl-fuzz, show off its features, and
gives an example of things it has found (and are public) in PHP.
